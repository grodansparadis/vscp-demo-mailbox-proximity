# vscp-demo-proximity-sensor
Proximity sensor based on deep sleep battery powered ESP8266

This project uses a proximity sensor to detect movement and send events either to a VSCP host ot a MQTT broker when movement is detected.

As the setup is battery powered the system is in deep sleep most of the time and only awakens when movement is dedtected.

This demo is part of the VSCP project [https://www.vscp.org](https://www.vscp.org)
